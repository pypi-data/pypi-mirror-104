# netbuild
The Python Network Building Tool (or 'netbuilder' package) is a terrific tool for students and networking
enthusiasts alike, which provides helpful functions for IP schema creation and subnetting.  It has four
primary modes, including a guide/walkthrough and a quick start variatn for both IPv4 and IPv6.

You can use this tool to create a subnet plan for an IPv4 network, check address classes, check public and
private addresses (as well as special addresses), expand and/or compress an IPv6 address, and check IP ranges
or /64 network counts for an IPv6 network.
