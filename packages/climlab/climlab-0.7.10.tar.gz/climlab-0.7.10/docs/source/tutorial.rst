For a comprehensive set of climlab usage examples embeded within lecture notes on climate science,
see Brian's online textbook `The Climate Laboratory <https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/>`_.

Below is a older collection of Jupyter notebooks giving example climlab usage.
These notebooks are based on classroom material developed by Brian Rose at the University at Albany.

*WARNING, many of these may be out of date. You're probably better off looking at the Climate Laboratory book!*

The notebooks can be viewed on `nbviewer <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org>`_ through the links below. If you want to run the code yourself, these notes are all available as Jupyter *.ipynb files
in the ``courseware`` directory of the `climlab source <https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab>`_.
