Description: # sec-vault
        ## Overview
        `sec-vault` is a SWISS army knife toolkit for in-house password management which provides interfaces for experts 
        who wish to have a more granular control on choosing external
        - cipher suites and primitives
        - cryptographic libraries 
        - toolkits/utilities of their choice
        
        > **Note:** Use this password management solution at your own risk. I do not claim any responsibility towards the use of this software.
        > The strength of the files in the vault is determined by the cipher suite incorporated along with the cryptographic primitives used to configure
        > the same. Unless you are technically adept, please avoid using this program at all costs.
