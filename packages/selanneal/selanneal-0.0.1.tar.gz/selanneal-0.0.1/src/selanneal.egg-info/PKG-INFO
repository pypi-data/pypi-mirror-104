Description: # selanneal
        
        Selanneal is a simple package for optimising multivariate selections via a figure of merit.
        The optimisation is performed for all given features simultaneously by utilising the simulated annealing method.
        It relies on [numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) for just-in-time compilation of the algorithm.
        The procedure works on binned data, so an n-dimensional histogram needs to be provided.
        
        Currently, two modes of operation exist:
        * **edges**: cut only the edges of each feature (results in "rectangular cuts")
        * **bins**: select individual bins from a grid (for now limited to 2 feature dimensions)
        
        This package was written for applications in high energy physics but can apply to general problems in statistical data analysis.
