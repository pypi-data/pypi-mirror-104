def linear_interp(x_data, baseline_points=()):
    """
    Creates a linear baseline constructed from points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The x-values of the measured data.
    baseline_points : Iterable(Container(float, float))
        An iterable of ((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)) values for
        each point representing the baseline. Must be at least two points
        to have a non-zero baseline.

    Returns
    -------
    z : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The baseline array constructed from connecting line segments between
        each background point.
    dict
        An empty dictionary, just to match the output of all other algorithms.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        Raised if there are less than two points in baseline_points.

    Notes
    -----
    Assumes the background is represented by lines connecting each of the
    specified background points.
