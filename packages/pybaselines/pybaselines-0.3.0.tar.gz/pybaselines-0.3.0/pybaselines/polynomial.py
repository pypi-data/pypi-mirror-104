    """
    Scales the polynomial coefficients back to the original domain of the data.

    For fitting, the x-values are scaled from their original domain, [min(x),
    max(x)], to [-1, 1] in order to improve the numerical stability of fitting.
    This function rescales the retrieved polynomial coefficients for the fit
    x-values back to the original domain.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coef : array-like
        The array of coefficients for the polynomial. Should increase in
        order, for example (c0, c1, c2) from `y = c0 + c1 * x + c2 * x**2`.
    original_domain : array-like, shape (2,)
        The domain, [min(x), max(x)], of the original data used for fitting.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        The array of coefficients scaled for the original domain.

        A dictionary with the following items:

    ----------
    data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
    x_data : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The x-values of the measured data. Default is None, which will create an
        array from -1 to 1 with N points.
    poly_order : int, optional
        The polynomial order for fitting the baseline. Default is 2.
    tol : float, optional
        The exit criteria. Default is 1e-3.
    max_iter : int, optional
        The maximum number of iterations. Default is 250.
    weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The weighting array. If None (default), then will be an array with
        size equal to N and all values set to 1.
    cost_function : str, optional
        The non-quadratic cost function to minimize. Must indicate symmetry of the
        method by appending 'a' or 'asymmetric' for asymmetric loss, and 's' or
        'symmetric' for symmetric loss. Default is 'asymmetric_truncated_quadratic'.
        Available methods, and their associated reference, are:

            * 'asymmetric_truncated_quadratic'[7]_
            * 'symmetric_truncated_quadratic'[7]_

            * 'asymmetric_indec'[9]_
            * 'symmetric_indec'[9]_

    threshold : float, optional
        The threshold value for the loss method, where the function goes from
        quadratic loss (such as used for least squares) to non-quadratic. For
        symmetric loss methods, residual values with absolute value less than
        threshold will have quadratic loss. For asymmetric loss methods, residual
        values less than the threshold will have quadratic loss. Default is None,
        which sets `threshold` to one-tenth of the standard deviation of the input
        data.
    alpha_factor : float, optional
        A value between 0 and 1 that controls the value of the penalty. Default is
        0.99. Typically should not need to change this value.
    return_coef : bool, optional
        If True, will convert the polynomial coefficients for the fit baseline to
        a form that fits the input x_data and return them in the params dictionary.
        Default is False, since the conversion takes time.

    Returns
    -------
    z : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The calculated baseline.
    params : dict
        A dictionary with the following items:

        * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The weight array used for fitting the data.
        * 'coef': numpy.ndarray, shape (poly_order + 1,)
            Only if `return_coef` is True. The array of polynomial parameters
            for the baseline, in increasing order. Can be used to create a
            polynomial using numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial().

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if `alpha_factor` is not between 0 and 1.

    Notes
    -----
    In baseline literature, this procedure is sometimes called "backcor".

    The square root of Tukey's bisquare function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    residual : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The residual array of the fit.
    scale : float, optional
        A scale factor applied to the weighted residuals to control the
        robustness of the fit. Default is 3.0.
    symmetric : bool, optional
        If False (default), will apply weighting asymmetrically, with residuals
        < 0 having full weight. If True, will apply weighting the same for both
        positive and negative residuals, which is regular LOESS.

    Returns
    -------
    weights : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The weighting array.

    Notes
    -----
    The function is technically sqrt(Tukey's bisquare) since the outer
    power of 2 is not performed. This is intentional, so that the square
    root for weighting in least squares does not need to be done, speeding
    up the calculation.

        be the difference of the two arrays.
    array_2 : numpy.ndarray, optional

    """
    Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS).

    Performs polynomial regression at each data point using the nearest points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
    x_data : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The x-values of the measured data. Default is None, which will create an
        array from -1 to 1 with N points.
    fraction : float, optional
        The fraction of N data points to include for the fitting on each point.
        Default is 0.2. Not used if `total_points` is not None.
    total_points : int, optional
        The total number of points to include for the fitting on each point. Default
        is None, which will use fraction * N to determine the number of points.
    scale : float, optional
        A scale factor applied to the weighted residuals to control the robustness
        of the fit. Default is 3.0, as used in [10]_. Note that the original loess
        procedure in [11]_ used a `scale` of 4.05.
    poly_order : int, optional
        The polynomial order for fitting the baseline. Default is 1.
    tol : float, optional
        The exit criteria. Default is 1e-3.
    max_iter : int, optional
        The maximum number of iterations. Default is 10.
    symmetric_weights : bool, optional
        If False (default), will apply weighting asymmetrically, with residuals
        < 0 having a weight of 1, according to [10]_. If True, will apply weighting
        the same for both positive and negative residuals, which is regular LOESS.
        If `use_threshold` is True, this parameter is ignored.
    use_threshold : bool, optional
        If False (default), will compute weights each iteration to perform the
        robust fitting, which is regular LOESS. If True, will apply a threshold
        on the data being fit each iteration, based on the maximum values of the
        data and the fit baseline, as proposed by [12]_, similar to the ModPoly
        and IModPoly techniques.
    num_std : float, optional
        The number of standard deviations to include when thresholding. Default
        is 1, which is the value used for the IModPoly technique. Only used if
        `use_threshold` is True.

    Returns
    -------
    z : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The calculated baseline.
    dict
        An empty dictionary, just to match the output of all other algorithms.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if the number of points for the fitting is less than 2.

    Notes
    -----
    The iterative, robust, aspect of the fitting can be achieved either through
    reweighting based on the residuals (the typical usage), or thresholding the
    fit data based on the residuals, as proposed by [12]_, similar to the ModPoly
    and IModPoly techniques.

    In baseline literature, this procedure is sometimes called "rbe", meaning
    "robust baseline estimate".
