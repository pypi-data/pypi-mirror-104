# AALpy - An Active Automata Learning Library

AALpy is a light-weight active automata learning library written in pure Python. 
By implementing a single method and a few lines of 
configuration, you can start learning automata. 

Whether you work with regular languages or you would like to learn models of 
reactive systems, AALpy supports a wide range of modeling formalisms, including 
deterministic, non-deterministic, and stochastic automata. 
You can use it to learn **deterministic finite automata**, **Moore machines**, 
and **Mealy machines** of deterministic systems. 
If the system that you would like to learn shows non-deterministic or
stochastic behavior, AALpy allows you to learn **observable
nondeterministic finite-state machines**, **Markov decision processes**, 
or **stochastic Mealy machines**.

AALpy enables efficient learning by providing a **large set of equivalence oracles**, implementing various **conformance testing** strategies. Learning 
is mostly based on Angluin's [L* algorithm](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/teaching/s10/papers/angluin87.pdf), for which AALpy supports a 
selection of optimizations, including **efficient counterexample processing**.
Finally, support for learning **abstracted non-deterministic Mealy machines** 
enables efficient learning of system models with large input space. 

If you miss a specific feature in AALpy, you can easily extend it. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install AALpy.
```bash
pip install aalpy
```
The minimum required version of Python is 3.6.  
Ensure that you have [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) installed and added to your path if you want to visualize models.

For manual installation, clone the master and install the following dependency.
```bash
pip install pydot
# and to install the library
python setup.py install
```

please check out our **Wiki**. On Wiki, you will find more detailed examples on how to use AALpy.

[Examples.py](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/blob/master/Examples.py) contains many examples demonstrating all AALpy functionality are presented. 

## Usage

All automata learning procedures follow this high-level approach:
- [Define the input alphabet and system under learning (SUL)](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/SUL-Interface,-or-How-to-Learn-Your-Systems)
- [Choose the equivalence oracle](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Equivalence-Oracles)
- [Run the learning algorithm](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Setting-Up-Learning)

If you would like to learn a black-box Date Validator's behavior, your AALpy configuration would look something like this:
```python
from aalpy.base import SUL
from aalpy.utils import visualize_automaton, DateValidator
from aalpy.oracles import StatePrefixEqOracle
from aalpy.learning_algs import run_Lstar

class DateSUL(SUL):
    """
    An example implementation of a system under learning that 
    can be used to learn the behavior of the date validator.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # DateValidator is a black-box class used for date string verification
        # The ormat of the dates is %d/%m/%Y'
        # Its method is_date_accepted returns True if date is accepted, False otherwise
        self.dv = DateValidator()
        self.string = ""

    def pre(self):
        # reset the string used for testing
        self.string = ""
        pass

    def post(self):
        pass

    def step(self, letter):
        # add the input to the current string
        if letter is not None:
            self.string += str(letter)

        # test if the current sting is accepted
        return self.dv.is_date_accepted(self.string)


# instantiate the SUL
sul = DateSUL()

# define the input alphabet
alphabet = list(range(0, 9)) + ['/']

# define a equivalence oracle

eq_oracle = StatePrefixEqOracle(alphabet, sul, walks_per_state=500, walk_len=15)

# run the learning algorithm

learned_model = run_Lstar(alphabet, sul, eq_oracle, automaton_type='dfa')
# visualize the automaton
visualize_automaton(learned_model)
```

The following snippet demonstrates a short example in which an automaton is either [loaded](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Loading,Saving,-Syntax-and-Visualization-of-Automata) or [randomly generated](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Generation-of-Random-Automata) and then [learned](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki/Setting-Up-Learning).
```python
from aalpy.utils import load_automaton_from_file, save_automaton_to_file, visualize_automaton, generate_random_dfa
from aalpy.SULs import DfaSUL
from aalpy.oracles import RandomWalkEqOracle
from aalpy.learning_algs import run_Lstar

# load an automaton
automaton = load_automaton_from_file('path_to_the_file.dot', automaton_type='dfa')

# or randomly generate one
random_dfa = generate_random_dfa(alphabet=[1,2,3,4,5],num_states=20, num_accepting_states=8)
big_random_dfa = generate_random_dfa(alphabet=[1,2,3,4,5],num_states=2000, num_accepting_states=500)

# get input alphabet of the automaton
alphabet = random_dfa.get_input_alphabet()

# create a SUL instance for the automaton/system under learning
sul = DfaSUL(random_dfa)

# define the equivalence oracle
eq_oracle = RandomWalkEqOracle(alphabet, sul, num_steps=5000, reset_prob=0.09)

# start learning
learned_dfa = run_Lstar(alphabet, sul, eq_oracle, automaton_type='dfa')

# save automaton to file and visualize it
save_automaton_to_file(learned_dfa, path='Learned_Automaton', file_type='dot')

# visualize automaton
visualize_automaton(learned_dfa)
# or just print its DOT representation
print(automaton)
```

To make experiments reproducible, define a random seed at the beginning of your program.
```Python
from random import seed
seed(2) # all experiments will be reproducible
```
