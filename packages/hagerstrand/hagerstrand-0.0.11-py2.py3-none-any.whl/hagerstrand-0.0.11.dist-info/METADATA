## Introduction
**Hagerstrand** is a Python package for a space-time GIS for individual-level human phenomena based on [Torsten Hägerstrand's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsten_H%C3%A4gerstrand) time geographic framework. Investigation of individual activity patterns in a geographic information system (GIS) has been an interest for many geographers and geographic information scientists since Hägerstrand's seminal article, [*What about people in regional science?*](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01936872) in 1970. However, there lacks a uniform implementation of the concepts in the time geographic framework in a GIS across the academic research community. Esri's ArcGIS platforms have various functions for analysis, visualization, and querying of space-time data but are rather limited and only commercially available. This package is continually developed to enable for more comprehensive space-time GIS processes in an open-source Python environment, and can also be used to explore individual human dynamics (e.g. accessibility to various human needs and services.)

## Installation

**Pip**

`pip install hagerstrand`

**Conda**

Installing `hagerstrand` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `hagerstrand` can be installed with:

```
conda install hagerstrand
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `hagerstrand` available on your platform with:

```
conda search hagerstrand --channel conda-forge
```
## Features

- Create an interactive map
- Add local datasets (e.g. GeoJSON, JSON, Shapefile) to the map either through code or GUI
- Add pandas DataFrames and GeoPandas GeoDataFrames to the map
- Use a widget for quick viewing of filtered results of a pd.DataFrame
- Filter any non-TileLayer in the map by a unique value in a field/column
- Process SafeGraph data and unpack json columns into an existing or a new DataFrame
