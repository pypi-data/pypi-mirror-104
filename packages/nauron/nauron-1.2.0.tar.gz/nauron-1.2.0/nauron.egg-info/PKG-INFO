Description: # Nauron
        
        Nauron is a Flask wrapper for Python designed to enable simple creation of distributed API services.
         By default, the services communicate via a RabbitMQ message broker and was designed with neural networks in mind to
         keep GPU-accelerated processes separate from the API logic. The API gateway is responsible for some request
          preprocesing, verification and routing, as well as serving any static
         endpoints.
        
        New services can be added by implementing the Service class and creating an Endpoint instance
