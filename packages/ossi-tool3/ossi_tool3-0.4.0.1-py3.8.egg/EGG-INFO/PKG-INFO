Description: ossi_tool
        -------------------------
        
        It is a Python script to emulate Avaya SAT (Communication Manager Site Administration Tool)
        to execute multiple commands, and write output data into the CSV file for later processing.
        It should be ideal tool to repeat a command multiple times which not available as import in
        Avaya Site Administration Tool (eg. list usage).
        
        As input arguments need to define the followings:
            - host
            - Username
            - Password
            - Input file
            - Output file
        
        For all available option use "ossi_tool3 -h" 
        
        Usage example:
        
        #ossi_tool3 192.168.10.10 sampleuser -ppassword -i commands.csv -o outputfile.csv

        Known issues:
        -------------
        
        - If the RSA key of the host where want to connect not in the .ssh/known_hosts file, than it drops an exception.
            Workaround:
            ssh to the host with regular ssh and accept the RSA key.
        - Some of the 'list measurement' commands does not provide general output, so it will drop error
