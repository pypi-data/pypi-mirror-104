# pymmWave

Documentation can be found here: https://pymmwave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#

Goals:
An easy to use mmWave library to get up and running within minutes.
Simple data interfacing, and complete type hinting.
Easy classes to implement for custom implementations.

This library is reliant on Python's asyncio package. User applications should interface with this tool with some sort of event loop manager.
Future support around this may be built.

This is designed to function with the COTS TI IWR6843AOP system. The abstract classes are designed to be used in a more generic manner, and have been already used to implement a 2D LiDAR solution.

Please read the license file and note that this software is still in an ALPHA state. 

Please report any bugs as Github issues.

TODO:
 - Pose estimation based on trajectory.
 - Perhaps continuous estimated state management.
