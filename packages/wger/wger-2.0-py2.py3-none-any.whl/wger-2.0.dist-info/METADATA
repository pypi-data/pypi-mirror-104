# wger

wger (ˈvɛɡɐ) Workout Manager is a free, open source web application that help
you manage your personal workouts, weight and diet plans and can also be used
as a simple gym management utility. It offers a REST API as well, for easy
integration with other projects and tools.

For a live system, refer to the project's site: <https://wger.de/>

## Installation

These are the basic steps to install and run the application locally on a Linux
system. There are more detailed instructions, other deployment options as well
as an administration guide available at <https://wger.readthedocs.io> or locally
in your code repository in the docs folder.

Please consult the commands' help for further information and available
parameters.


### Production

If you want to host your own instance, take a look at the provided docker
compose file. This config will persist your database and uploaded images:

<https://github.com/wger-project/docker>

### Demo

If you just want to try it out:

```shell script
    docker run -ti --name wger.apache --publish 8000:80 wger/apache
```

Then just open <http://localhost:8000> and log in as **admin**, password **adminadmin**

Please note that this image will overwrite your data when you pull a new version,
it is only intended as an easy to setup demo

### Development version

#### Docker

We provide a docker compose file that sets everything up for development and
persists the database on a volume. From the root folder just call 

````shell script
docker-compose -f extras/docker/compose/docker-compose.yml up
````

For more info, check the [README in wger/extras/docker/compose](
 ./extras/docker/compose/README.md
).

#### Local installation (git)

**Note:** You can safely install from master, it is almost always in a usable
and stable state.


Install the necessary packages

```shell script
sudo apt-get install python3-dev nodejs npm git
sudo npm install -g yarn sass
```

Make a virtualenv where we will install the python packages

```shell script
python3 -m venv venv-wger
source venv-wger/bin/activate
```

Start the application. This will download the required JS and CSS libraries
and create a SQlite database and populate it with data on the first run. If
you want to use another database, edit the settings.py file before calling
bootstrap. You will need to create the database and user yourself.

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/wger-project/wger.git
cd wger
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py develop
wger create-settings
wger bootstrap
wger load-online-fixtures
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Log in as: **admin**, password **adminadmin**

After the first run you just start django's development server::

```shell script
python manage.py runserver
```


### Command line options

You can get a list of all available commands by calling ``wger`` without any
arguments:

* `bootstrap` Performs all steps necessary to bootstrap the application
* `config-location` Returns the default location for the settings file
   and the data folder
* `create-or-reset-admin` Creates an admin user or resets the password
   for an existing one
* `create-settings` Creates a local settings file
* `load-fixtures` Loads all fixtures
* `migrate-db` Run all database migrations
* `start` Start the application using django's built in webserver

To get help on a specific command: ``wger <command> --help``.
