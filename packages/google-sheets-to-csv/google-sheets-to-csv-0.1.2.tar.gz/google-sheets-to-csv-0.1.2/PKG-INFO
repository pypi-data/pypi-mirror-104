        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        
        Converter options:
          --service-account-credential-file SERVICE_ACCOUNT
                                If you want to use this command in a script without
                                user interractions, you can create a service account
                                from google console:
                                https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-
                                credentials#create_a_service_account and share read
                                access sheets you want to export. (default: None)
          -f, --force           Tell this app tp overwrite existing files if present.
                                (default: False)
          -b BUFFER_LINES, --buffer-lines BUFFER_LINES
                                Maximum number of lines to retreive by http calls.
                                (default: 500)
          spreadsheet           Id of the spreadsheet you want to export to csv.
                                Spreadsheet id is the weird data present in the uri
                                just after `d/`:
                                https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<the
                                spreadsheet id is here>/
          selector              Sheet selector is a regex expression to match sheets
                                titles. Some examples: - `.*`: would export all sheets
                                - `(abcd)|(efgh)`: would export abcd and efgh sheets
          directory             Output directory with write access where csv files
                                will bewritten.
        
        Logging params:
          --logging-file LOGGING_FILE
                                Logging configuration file, (logging-level and
                                logging-format are ignored if provide) (default: None)
          --logging-level LOGGING_LEVEL
          --logging-format LOGGING_FORMAT
        
        This will create a .csv file per sheet with title match with the regex
        expression.
        ```
        
        ## Authentication
        
        There are two ways to let this program access to your google sheets:
        
        * You can provide [google service account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_a_service_account)
          credentials with `--service-account-credential-file` option.
        
        * By default script will open your browser that let you authorize (or not)
          readonly access to **all your Google Sheets documents** to this application
          which is running on your computer. An authorization token
          will be saved in your home directory: `.gs-to-csv-token.json`
          (You can control that path using `GS_TO_CSV_TOKEN_FILE_PATH` env
          variable)
        
        ## Behavior (limitations)
        
        * Google sheets API give a `columnCount` value which is a bit useless
          as we get extra cells. So for convenience this return, for each row,
          the same number of cells as the first line (expected header line!)
          which can result with empty lines or truncated data.
        
        * lines without any values do not return blank line even in the middle
          of the sheet.
