    Execute a blackbox attack using an evolutionary strategy that creates a
    perturbation per eligible data point in each file of the data set and
    returns a plot showing the performance of the model on the clean and
    the perturbed data.

    The perturbation is crafted to make the model classify the data point
    as the category given by target_category while minimizing the perturbation
    size. More specifically, the algorithm tries to keep the sum over the
    coordinates of the distance between the respective coordinate
    of the perturbed and the original data point small. If the nth feature
    is qualitative, the distance between the nth coordinate of a point x
    and a point x' is

    * 0 if x'[n] == x[n]
    * distance_weights[n] if x'[n] != x[n]

    Conversely, if the nth feature in quantitative, the distance between the
    nth coordinate of a point x and a point x' is calculated as

    distance_weights[n] * abs(x'[n] - x[n])

    The algorithm finds the point using an evolution strategy, automatically
    adapting the variance in each coordinate.

    Currently, this attack strategy can be applied to classification models.
    The data set may consist of both quantitative and qualitative
    variables.

    :param model: path to the configuration file (.toml file) that contains
        the metadata of the model
    :param distance_weights: array of weights to multiply the distance
        in each coordinate with. If set to None, reasonable default values are
        calculated depending on the value range for quantitative and the
        number of categories for categorical features.
    :param evolutionary_steps: the number of generations the population goes
        through

        strategy uses
    :param selection_nr: the number of members of the population to be

        the points classified as
