    """
    Execute a Peak Attack that creates a perturbation per eligible data
    point in each file of the data set and return a plot showing the performance
    of the model on the clean and the perturbed data.

    The perturbations affect perturbation_length values starting at some point
    after start_index. The attack compares the MSE values of the different
    perturbations and using gradient information it optimizes the deviation of
    the predictions from the labels to find the consecutive data points in the
    data set where the highest possible "peak" error is achieved. For
    multiregression models, only the error of the output variable whose index
    is given by target_output is considered.

    The idea is to find the area in the file after start_index where the
    perturbation of perturbation_length values has the biggest impact.

    Currently, this attack strategy can be applied to Keras (multi-)regression
    recurrent ML models and the data set must consist only of quantitative
    variables.

    :param start_index: data points before this index will not be perturbed
    :param perturbation_length: number of data points perturbed
    :param iteration_step: number of iterations in the attack
    :param mask: list of binary values that decide whether a variable can be
        perturbed by the attack, the list length must be the number of
        variables
    :param step_length: number of time steps with constant value before next
        increase or decrease

        to maximize the error of (only relevant for multiregression models)
