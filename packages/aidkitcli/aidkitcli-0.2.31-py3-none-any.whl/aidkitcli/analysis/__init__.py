"""Every quality analysis belongs to one of the three central AI quality
dimensions: functionality, comprehensibility (XAI) and robustness.

An analysis provides plots and metrics that help you understand the quality
level of your AI model. The plots can be used as visual support in your
quality reports and the metrics can be used as a threshold for your CI/CD
ML training pipeline.
