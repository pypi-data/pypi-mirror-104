    """
    Execute a Correlation Attack that creates a perturbation per eligible data
    point in each file of the data set and return a plot showing the performance
    of the model on the clean and the perturbed data.

    By default, all the data points are eligible to be perturbed. This changes
    if step_length determines that a certain number of consecutive
    perturbations should be the same or if start_index/perturbation_length
    limits the number of data points that can be perturbed in a data file.

    The perturbations are generated via a gradient-based optimization
    algorithm whose objective function penalizes the correlation between the
    predicted values and the true labels. For multiregression models, the
    objective function considers the output coordinate given by target_output.

    Currently, this attack strategy can be applied to Keras (multi-)regression
    recurrent ML models and the data set must consist only of quantitative
    variables.

    :param data: name of the data set
    :param model: path to the configuration file (.toml file) that contains
        the metadata of the model
    :param epsilon: array of maximal L^inf perturbations for every variable
    :param start_index: data points before this index will not be perturbed
    :param perturbation_length: number of data points perturbed
    :param iteration_step: number of iterations in the attack
    :param mask: list of binary values that decide whether a variable can be
        perturbed by the attack, the list length must be the number of
        variables
    :param step_length: number of time steps with constant value before next
        increase or decrease
    :param target_output: the index of the output neuron the algorithm tries
        to modify (only relevant for multiregression models)
    :param title: title of the configuration (default: "Config Correlation
        Attack")
