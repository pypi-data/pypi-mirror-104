    Execute an Increase Corruption and return a plot showing
    the performance of the model on the corrupted data.

    The values of the selected variable are first set to the start_constant
    value and then changed every step_length data points in the file.
    Depending on whether end_constant is bigger or smaller than
    start_constant, the values are increased or decreased after step_length
    data points.

    This corruption can only be applied to quantitative input variables. The
    supported ML models are:

    - Keras regression recurrent models
    - Keras classification feedforward models
    - scikit-learn classification feedforward models
