    Create a RequestModel for a Coordinate Descent Classification attack that
    creates a  perturbation per eligible data point in each file of the data
    set and returns a plot showing the performance of the model on the clean
    and the perturbed data. The Coordinate Descend Classification attack
    follows a black-box approach in that it does not use any gradient
    information.

    The perturbation is crafted to make the model classify the data point
    as the category given by target_category while minimizing the perturbation
    size. More specifically, the algorithm tries to keep the sum over the
    coordinates of the distance between the respective coordinate
    of the perturbed and the original data point small. If the nth feature
    is qualitative, the distance between the nth coordinate of a point x
    and a point x' is

    * 0 if x'[n] == x[n]
    * distance_weights[n] if x'[n] != x[n]

    Conversely, if the nth feature in quantitative, the distance between the
    nth coordinate of a point x and a point x' is calculated as

    distance_weights[n] * abs(x'[n] - x[n])

    The algorithm finds the point by estimating which coordinate should be
    changed to find the best point, and then changing the value of only this
    coordinate. It repeats this process until it cannot find a better point,
    but at most iteration_steps times.

    Currently, this attack strategy can be applied to classification models.
    The data set may consist of both quantitative and qualitative
    variables.

        in each coordinate with. If set to None, reasonable default values are
        calculated depending on the value range for quantitative and the
        number of features for categorical features
