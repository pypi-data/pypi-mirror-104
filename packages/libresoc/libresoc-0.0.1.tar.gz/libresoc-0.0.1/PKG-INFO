        # Installation
        
        Best done using the dev-env-setup scripts:
        https://git.libre-soc.org/?p=dev-env-setup.git;a=summary
        
            make install
            make test # optional (ish)
        
        # Running Simulator tests
        
        qemu and gdb for Power 64 are required.  qemu can be installed with
        "apt-get install qemu-system-ppc64", however gdb needs compiling from
        source.  The simplest way is to use this dev-env-script:
