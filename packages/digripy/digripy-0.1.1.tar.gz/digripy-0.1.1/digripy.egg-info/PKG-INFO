Description: # DiGriPy
        District Heating Grid Simulation in Python
        
        ## Installation
        For installation, you can clone this repository and use pip for solving dependencies and installation.
        Please use Python3 <3.9, as CoolProp fails to install on Python 3.9.
        ```
        python -m pip install digripy
        ```
        
        You can alternatively manually clone this repo and then
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        in the cloned directory.
        
        ## Running
        For Running DiGriPy you can simply download the `tests` folder provided in the [git repository](https://github.com/lvorspel/DiGriPy) and run
        ```
        python -m digripy.run -i tests/example80C -l 20
        ```
        
        in a command line. This will run the first 20 time steps of the medium temperature scenario and display the results in a browser.
        
        ## Output
        Results will not only be displayed in the browser, but also will be saved in your home directory in a folder called `digripy_results`. There you can also find spreadsheets with several results.
