Description: # pywhycon ![Whycon tag with ID](whycon-code.jpg)
        
        Python wrapper for Whycon.
        
        ### Whycon is precise, efficient and low-cost localization system 
        
        _WhyCon_ is a version of a vision-based localization system that can be used with low-cost web cameras, and achieves millimiter precision with very high performance.
        The system is capable of efficient real-time detection and precise position estimation of several circular markers in a video stream. 
        It can be used both off-line, as a source of ground-truth for robotics experiments, or on-line as a component of robotic systems that require real-time, precise position estimation.
        _WhyCon_ is meant as an alternative to widely used and expensive localization systems. It is fully open-source.
        _WhyCon-orig_ is WhyCon's original, minimalistic version that was supposed to be ROS and openCV independent.
        
        
        ### <a name="dependencies">Dependencies</a>
        
        * <b>OpenCV</b>
        * <b>Whycon Core library</b> - see bellow
        * <b>pkconfig</b> - only for module building
        * <b>pybind11</b> - only for module building

        ### <a name="install">Install</a>
        
        You have to install the package from your **active python environment**.
        
        Depending on your environment, you may need to enter something like
        
        `conda activate _your_python_environment_name_` 
        
        or 
        
        `workon _your_python_environment_name_`.
        
        
        #### Makefile
        
        Compile and linking module to **./bin/whycon.so**.
        
        (It also compiles the _Whycon Core library_.)
        
            make
        
        #### setup.py
        
            ./setup.py install
        
        (It calls the make [see above] and installs the whycon package in the current python environment.)
        
        
        #### Pip
        
            pip install whycon
        
        ## Examples
        
        Examples are in the _usecases_ directory in the <a href="https://github.com/ivomarvan/pywhycon">repo on GitHub</a>.
        
        #### show_help.py
        
        It only tests that the module was installed successfully. It prints the help message of the module.
        
        #### camera_test.py
        
        Turn on the USB webcam and see what it sees. 
        If Whycon-markers are found in the image, they will be highlighted 
        and their found properties will be written to the console.
        
        #### autocalibration_test.py
        
        Automatic calibration of space transformation parameters by monitoring 
        four WhyCon markers arranged in a square 
        (with the configured length of its side).
        
        ###### web_camera.py  
        
        Auxiliary object, camera abstraction.
        (Searches for the first unshaded camera.)
        
        ###### window.py
        
        Auxiliary object, Screen window abstraction.
        
        
        #### Whycon core library as a submodule
        
        The Whycon core library is a git submodule of this repository.
        
        If you do not have a _whycon_core_ directory in the root directory, enter
        
            git submodule init
            git submodule update
        
        
        ### <a name="whycon_core">Whycon Core library</a>
        The package (pywhycon) is a wrapper of the <a href="https://github.com/ivomarvan/whycon_core">Whycon core library</a>. 
        
        **For citations of articles, contacts to the original author, please see these pages. You will also find citations of projects that contributed to the development of the Whycon.**

        ### A precise, efficient and low-cost localization system 
        
        _WhyCon_ is a version of a vision-based localization system that can be used with low-cost web cameras, and achieves millimiter precision with very high performance.
        The system is capable of efficient real-time detection and precise position estimation of several circular markers in a video stream. 
        It can be used both off-line, as a source of ground-truth for robotics experiments, or on-line as a component of robotic systems that require real-time, precise position estimation.
        _WhyCon_ is meant as an alternative to widely used and expensive localization systems. It is fully open-source.
        _WhyCon-orig_ is WhyCon's original, minimalistic version that was supposed to be ROS and openCV independent.
        
        
        The _WhyCon_ system was developed as a joint project between the University of Buenos Aires, Czech Technical University and University of Lincoln, UK.
        The main contributors were [Matias Nitsche](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z0hQoRUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Tom Krajnik](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Qv3nqgsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Jan Faigl](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-finD_sAAAAJ&hl=en). Each of these contributors maintains a slightly different version of WhyCon.
        
        ## History of the repo
        
        There are many implementations of this idea on GitHub. Because they come from the scientific environment, they are at different stages of development and with different modifications.
        The goal of this implementation is to enable the development of the core of this idea as an independent library that can be used by other projects.
        
        The basis for this library is the implementation from https://github.com/jiriUlr/whycon-ros.
        
        There is a fully functional reproduction of individual marks in the image, as well as their identification (WhyCode).

        #### Where is it described ?
        
        <i>WhyCon</i> was first presented on International Conference on Advanced Robotics 2013 [[2](#references)], later in the Journal of Intelligent and Robotics Systems [[1](#references)] and finally at the Workshop on Open Source Aerial Robotics during the International Conference on Intelligent Robotic Systems, 2015 [[3](#references)]. Its early version was also presented at the International Conference of Robotics and Automation, 2013 [[4](#references)]. An extension of the system, which used a necklace code to add ID's to the tags, achieved a best paper award at the SAC 2017 conference [[5](#references)].

        * <b>opencv</b>
        
        ### <a name="build">How to build and install</a>
        ####In general
        To see a current variable setting of Makefile you can call 
        `make info`
        
        If you want to set a parameter, you can do it as follows
        `make info USE_OPENCV_FROM_PYTHON=1`
        (make USE_OPENCV_FROM_PYTHON=1)
        
        ####OpenCv and other (Python for example)
        Unfortunately, the current implementation is dependent on OpenCV. 
        If you expect to use the library with another application/library (such as Python), 
        you need to use the **same version of the OpenCV** library.
        
        If the variable USE_OPENCV_FROM_PYTHON = 1 (default is 0) 
        the makefile tries to find OpenCV, which is in the appropriate version of Python.
        
        If you use a **virtual** Python **environment**, you must **activate** it during the compilation.
        
        (For example 
        `conda activate <your enviroment>`
        or `source venv/bin/activate`
        , ...)
        
        ####Compilation and linking
        
        `make`
        
        or (for Python, inside of Python enviroment ) 
        
        `make USE_OPENCV_FROM_PYTHON=1` 
        
        
        #### <a name="install">Install</a>
        `sudo make install`
        
        
        #### <a name="uninstall">Uninstall</a>
        `sudo make uninstall`
        
        ### <a name="usecases">Projects that produce this library</a>
        * <a href="https://github.com/ivomarvan/pywhycon">Python wrapper for whycon (vision-based localization system)</a>
        
        ### <a name="todo">To Do List</a>
        * Transfer hidden parameters from code to configurations.
        * Add tests.  
        * Remove the dependency on opencv (used mainly for coordinate transformation).
