Description: # Science Data Challenge 2 scoring service CLI
        
        This package contains two simple command line interface (CLI) applications
        for interaction with the SDC2 online scoring service:
        
        - `sdc2-score` : A tool for upload and check the status of submissions.
        - `sdc2-score-admin`: A tool managing SDC2 users and groups.
        
        ## Installation
        
        This package can be installed with:
        
        ```shell
        pip install ska-sdc2-scoring-utils
        ```
        
        ## Using the `sdc2-score` command
        
        Create a submission and generate its SUBMISSION_ID using
        
        ```shell
        sdc2-score create CATALOGUE_FILE
        ```
        
        Retrieve information about the submission using
        
        ```shell
        sdc2-score info SUBMISSION_ID
        ```
        
        All submissions belonging to a team can be printed using
        
        ```shell
        sdc2-score ls
        ```
        
        By default, all commands are run against the 'full' dataset. The -c flag can be used to run commands against the 'dev' dataset.
        
        ### Credentials:
        
        Credentials  can either be specified using the command line options as follows:
        
        ```shell
        sdc2-score create -u USER -p PASSWORD CATALOGUE_FILE
        ```
        
        or are loaded from the following environment variables:
        
        - `SDC2_SCORER_USER`
        - `SDC2_SCORER_PASSWORD`
        
        If both are supplied, the command line option flags are used.
