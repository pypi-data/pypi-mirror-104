hydroMT-delwaq: DELWAQ plugin for hydroMT
#########################################

FIXME add badges with correct links

.. note::

  This minimal branch from the hydromt_plugin plugin can be used as a **template** to easily 
  implement new plugins for hydroMT. To implement a new model do:
  
  - replace all instances of `plugin` with the model name
  - edit license (default GPLv3)
  - edit model class (plugin.py) to be adapted for the new model
  - check and fix git installation (including pyproject.toml) including entry point
  - test "hydromt --models"
  - edit installation guide 
  - edit .github actions and envs/hydromt-plugin.yml environment
  - edit template documentation


hydroMT_ is a python package, developed by Deltares, to build and analysis hydro models.
It provides a generic model api with attributes to access the model schematization,
(dynamic) forcing data, results and states. This plugin provides an implementation 
for the DELWAQ_ model.
