    This state is entered if an ExperimentStartRequest was received in
    the TRANSCEIVING state. During this state, the
    ExperimentStartRequest is checked against a possibly already
    running experiment. If no experiment is running, the setup of the
    experiment is executed.

    ----------
    rgc: :class:`.RunGovernor`
        The run governor instance that provides the context for this
