Description: bloom-filter
        ============
        
        A pure python bloom filter (low storage requirement, probabilistic
        set datastructure) is provided.  It is known to work on CPython 3.x, Pypy,
        and Jython.
        
        Includes mmap, in-memory and disk-seek backends.
        
        This project builds on `drs-bloom-filter` and `bloom_filter_mod`.

        Usage
        -----
        
        The user specifies the desired maximum number of elements and the
        desired maximum false positive probability, and the module
        calculates the rest.
        
        ::
        
            from bloom_filter2 import BloomFilter
        
            # instantiate BloomFilter with custom settings,
            # max_elements is how many elements you expect the filter to hold.
            # error_rate defines accuracy; You can use defaults with
            # `BloomFilter()` without any arguments. Following example
            # is same as defaults:
            bloom = BloomFilter(max_elements=10000, error_rate=0.1)
        
            # Test whether the bloom-filter has seen a key:
            assert "test-key" not in bloom
        
            # Mark the key as seen
            bloom.add("test-key")
        
            # Now check again
            assert "test-key" in bloom
