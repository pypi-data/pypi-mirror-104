djangolive package is basically a bunch of beautifully  crafted apps. It can also be considered
as a template project for new django developers. I will be adding new apps into the apps package.
Any feedbacks to improve the code quality, features, test are really appreciated. I am able to put
20Hrs every week to make the project alive. Any contributors with same wavelength are welcome to the
community.
