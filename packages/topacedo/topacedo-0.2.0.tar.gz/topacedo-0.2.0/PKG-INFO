Description: # TopACeDo
        #### Topology Assisted Cell Downsampling
        
        Topacedo works with Scarf to perform memory efficient downsampling of single-cell genomics data.
        Using a pre-built neighbourhood graph of cells, Topacedo aims to sample cells from the graph such 
        that the manifold is preserved. Topecedo's algorithm can be diveded into two phases:
        
        - assigning prizes to cells and penalties to edges
        - running a fast approximate prize-collecting steiner tree
