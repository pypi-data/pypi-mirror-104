# Example Package

This is a simple - empty - example package.

to upload to PyPI:

(see also https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)

<code>py -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*</code>

Note: uploading to testpypi did not work for me.
Instead, I could upload to PyPI directly (so without the --repository parameter)
