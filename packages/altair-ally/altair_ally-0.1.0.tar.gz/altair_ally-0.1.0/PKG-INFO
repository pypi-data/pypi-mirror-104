Description: # Altair Ally
        
        *This package is in early development and its name, API, etc might change rapidly. It is not yet on PyPI.*
        
        Altair Ally ("Aly" for short) is an companion package to Altair,
        which provides a few shortcuts to create common plots
        for exploratory data analysis (EDA),
        particularly those involving visualizing an entire dataset.
        The goal is to encourage good EDA habits
        by making it quick and simple to create these visualizations,
        and to provide useful default interactions with the plots.
        
        Thanks to the excellent API in Altair / Vega-Lite,
        some configuration is possible
        by using the built-in methods of the returned chart objects,
        but the general philosophy is that highly customized plots
        are better made in Altair directly.
        The package name is a nod to ggally
        which complements ggplot2 in a similar,
        but much more extensive manner.
