Description: # DEMICESTIMATOR
        
        ## Introduction
        <p>This package contains standalone code for computing data of any epidemic through various Epidemic Models (SIR, SEIR etc) . The data can be further used for studying, graphing, stimulating and predicting the spread of any epidemic.</p>
        
        **SIR Model:**
        A simple mathematical description of the spread of a disease in a population is the so-called SIR model, which divides the (fixed) population of N individuals into three "compartments" which may vary as a function of time.
        
        **SEIR Model:**
        For many important infections, there is a significant incubation period during which individuals have been infected but are not yet infectious themselves. During this period the individual is in compartment E (for exposed). This is where SEIR model is used.
        
        ## For The Users
        The package can be installed via:
        ```bash
        pip install epidemic_estimator
        ```
        <p>The package can be used to call the functions of available Epidemic Models</p>
        
        ## Example for SIR Model
        ```python
        import demicestimator as de
        de.sir_model(0.5,1/4,1000,0,1,160)
        print(de.sir_df)
        ```
        >Here you can call the function for SIR model using
        **ee.sir_model()**
        
        Parameters:
        - Effective contact Rate
        - Recovery Rate
        - Total population
        - Recovered
        - Infected
        - No. Of Days
        
        >Probable Epidemic Data is computed from the code above which can be used to plot graph, create stimulation and so on.
        
        ## Updates
        Further updates with support for other models like SEIR and SIS is coming soon.
