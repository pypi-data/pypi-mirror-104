Logging formatters for colorized outputs. A simple domain specific language for log messages which can be used to colorize all or part of a particular log message. For example:

LOG.debug('Found file at #g<%s>', path)

would colorize the contents of the 'path' variable green when output to a command line terminal.

A formatter which strips color sequences from the output is also included for situations like logging to files where it would not make sense to have ANSI color sequences embedded in the output.
