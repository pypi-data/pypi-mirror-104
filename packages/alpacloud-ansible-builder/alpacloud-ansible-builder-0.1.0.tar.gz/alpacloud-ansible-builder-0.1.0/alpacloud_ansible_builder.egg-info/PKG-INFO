Description: # alpacloud-ansible-builder
        
        This tool automatically builds and installs Ansible Collections.
        
        This is useful for testing out purpose built collections. It's also nice for testing collections. I think it's most useful for repositories with collections alongside deployments:
        
        ```
        - collections
        	- our_monitoring
        - deployments
        	- our_monitoring_staging
        	- our_monitoring_team_0
        	- our_monitoring_team_1
        	- our_monitoring_team_2
        ```
