Description: # Anonfiles.com Unofficial Python API
        
        This unofficial Python API was created to make uploading and downloading files
        from <anonfiles.com> simple and effective for programming in Python. The goal of
        the project is to create an intuitive library for anonymous file sharing.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local
        machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to
        deploy the project on a live system.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        Python 3.7+ is required to run this application, other than that there are no
        prerequisites for the project, as the dependencies are included in the repository.
        
        ### Installing
        
        To install the library is as simple as cloning the repository and running
        
        ```bash
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        It is recommended to create an virtual environment prior to installing this library.
        Alternatively, you can also install this library via Pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install anonfile
        ```
        
        And have fun!
        
        ### Dev Notes
        
        Run unit tests locally:
        
        ```bash
        pytest --verbosity=2 -s --token "REDACTED"
        ```
        
        Add the `-k test_*` option if you want to test only a single function.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Import the module and instantiate the `AnonFile()` constructor. Setting the download
        directory in `path` is optional.
        
        ```python
        from anonfile import AnonFile
        
        anon = AnonFile('api_key')
        
        # uploading a file
        upload = anon.upload('/home/guest/jims_paperwork.doc')
        print(upload.url.geturl())
        
        # downloading a file
        from pathlib import Path
        
        target_dir = Path.home().joinpath('Downloads')
        filename = anon.download("https://anonfiles.com/9ee1jcu6u9/test_txt", path=target_dir)
        print(filename)
        ```
        
        And voilÃ , pain-free anonymous file sharing. If you want more information about
        the `AnonFile` API visit [anonfiles.com](https://anonfiles.com/docs/api).
