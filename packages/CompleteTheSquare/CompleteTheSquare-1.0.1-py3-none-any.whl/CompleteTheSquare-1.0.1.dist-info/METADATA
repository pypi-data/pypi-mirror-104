# CompleteTheSquare

A Simple Python project to complete the square!

## What is "Completing The Square"
Completing The Square is a method used in Mathematics to easily find the turning point of a quadratic on the graph.  
It can also be used to find the roots (where it crosses the x-axis (x-intercept or y=0)), but the quadratic formula is more popular for this.

# How to use!
1) Install the module!
```
pip install CompleteTheSquare
```
2) Import the module!
```
from CompleteTheSquare import CompleteTheSquare as cts
```
> I have imported it as `cts` to make it easier

3) Initialise your equation
```py
eq = cts("x²+3x+2")
```
If you don't want to initialise an equation straight away, simply leave it as `""`
4) Complete The Square!
```py
eq.cts()
```
This will return the completed version (string)! Use `print()` to print it!
5) Solve!
```py
eq.solve()
```
This will return the solutions (list)! Use `print()` to print it!

If you want to initialise the equation outside, do:
```py
eq.equation = "2x²+6x+4"
```

## What do I need to input?
You must input `x` (lowercase).  
You don't need to add the power ², there just needs to be **something there**.  
x£ + 3x + 2 will give the same result as x² + 3x + 2 :P
