The ``smarts`` module contains functions for calling SMARTS: Simple Model of the
Atmoshperic Radiative Transfer of Sunshine, from NREL, developed by 
Dr. Christian Gueymard. 

SMARTS software can be obtained from: 
    https://www.nrel.gov/grid/solar-resource/smarts.html

Users will be responsible to obtain a copy of SMARTS  from NREL, 
honor itâ€™s license, and download the SMART files into their PVLib folder.

This wrapper is shared under a BSD-3-Clause License, and was
originally coded in Matlab by Juan Russo (2001), updated and ported to python
by Silvana Ayala (2019-2020). Original Matlab wrapper was made for graduate studies 
at the University of Arizona, python porting by NREL.
