Description: # pymkup
        
        pymkup is a Python library for viewing markups lists and property data in PDFs created by Bluebeam Revu.
        
        ## About
        
        This is a reverse-engineered unofficial API for accessing data generated in Bluebeam Revu authored PDFs. Once a file is loaded, it can be scraped for some information.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pymkup.
        
        ```bash
        pip install pymkup
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from pymkup import pymkup
        x = pymkup("link to your Revu PDF")
        x.spaces() # Returns JSON dictionary of document spaces.
        x.markups() # Returns JSON dictionary of markups.
        ```
        
        ### Data export with custom columns example
        
        First, you should identify the columns that are accessible in your file:
        ```python
        x.get_columns().values()
        ```
        
        Second, you should review the extended columns here that can also be added:
        ```python
        ['Page Number', 'Page Label', 'Measurement', 'Space']
        ```
        
        Lastly, you can build the custom columns that you want to see returned:
        ```python
        columns = ['Subject', 'Label', 'Date', 'UUID', 'Space']
        x.markups(column_list=columns)
        ```
        
        ## Requirements
        - pdfrw is a library for scraping PDF data in Python and doing some other manipulaton.
        - shapely to build Spaces.
