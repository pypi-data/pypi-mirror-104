Description: # bmww-api
        
        Use : pip install bmww-api==0.0.7
        
        to install this module
        
        Pypi url : https://pypi.org/project/bmww-api/
        
        Disclaimers:
        
        - This is not an official api and it is quite weak but it gets the job done.
        
        - DO NOT ABUSE REQUESTS SINCE IT CAN BE HARMFUL FOR THE WEB PAGE.
        
        
        Notes:
        
        
        - As said before this is not an official api and it was made by one person, so if you see any errors in the code or see a better way to do code it and know how to do it, you are welcome to edit it.
        
        
        - Information like genres or information that can be a list (ex: genres, categories, challenges, series) can't be accessed individually due to the way that the html was written. Again if you find a way to fix it or make it possible to access this information individually you are welcome to do it
        
        
        - If you want to access information like the ones stated above you would have to do .complete_info this will get the work's complete info
        
        
        - I may be updating this project with new features, however i don't really have much time to do it and since this is one of my first times using beautiful soup the code maybe a bit messy and with a lot of errors.
        
        
        Quick guide on how to use:
        
        ```
        #import module
        from bmwwAPI import bmww
        
        #create api object
        api = bmww()
        
        
        # create work from api '487' being the id of the work/fanfiction
        # https://batmanwonderwoman.com/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=487 the last 3 numbers of the url are the id of the work, those are the three numbers you need
        # if an id is not given the only information available is to get a random story
        
        # create a work object based on the api
        work = api.work(#id)
        
        # some of the functions of the api
        
        # get information out of a work/fanfic/series
        
        work_info = [

        # get information out of an users profile, this gets the information that the user chose to share, so no funny business here.
        # you don't have to specify any work's id except the users id
        
        # create an user object based on the api
        user = api.users()
        
        # some of the information that you can get from user's profiles
        
        # keep in mind that some of this information may not be available if the user chose not to share it
