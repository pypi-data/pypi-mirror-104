Description: # lifeproof
        Create proofs of life to detect when a program fails.
        
        ## Create a file proof of life
        
        To create a file proof of life is very simple. You only need to execute:
        
        ```python
        from lifeproof import FileProofOfLife
        
        with FileProofOfLife('file_path'):
               something_to_do()
        ```
        
        Where 'file_path' is the file path to the proof of life to check. If this file is removed, then the program has died for
        any cause. The something_to_do() represent the commands to check if they are still alive. If something_to_do() breaks
        down for some reason, the file automatically will be removed.
        
        For example:
        
        ```python
        from lifeproof import FileProofOfLife
        from time import sleep
        
        with FileProofOfLife('health.txt'):
               sleep(60)
        ```
        
        This script will create the file 'health.txt' during 60 seconds. At the end of sleep(60) the 'health.txt' file will be
        removed.
