Description: # xnemogcm
        
        Interface to open NEMO ocean global circulation model output dataset and create a xgcm grid.
        
        One can be interested by the [XORCA](https://github.com/willirath/xorca)
        python package, that does a similar work for
        all NEMO output grid. xnemogcm is designed to be more simple
        and adapted to a simple idealized configuration.
        
        ## Usage
        
        `xnemogcm` is capable or recombining the domain_cfg and mesh_mask files,
        the recombining tool from the NEMO toolbox is thus not needed here.
        
        ```python
        from pathlib import Path
        from xnemogcm import open_nemo_and_domain_cfg
        
        # Next line will open all the nemo files containing "grid_X" in their name ("X" being "T", "U", "V", "W", etc)
        # All the files containing "domain_cfg" or "mesh_mask" will also be opened
        ds = open_nemo_and_domain_cfg(
            nemo_files='/path/to/output/files',
            domcfg_files='/path/to/domain_cfg/mesh_mask/files'
        )
        
        # It is possible to give a list of the precise files
        ds = open_nemo_and_domain_cfg(
            nemo_files=Path('/path/to/nemo/files/').glob('ORCA_1m_*grid_*.nc'),
            domcfg_files=['/path/to/mesh_mask/mesh_mask_0000.nc', '/path/to/mesh_mask/mesh_mask_0001.nc']
        )
        
        # Interface with xgcm
        from xnemogcm import get_metrics
        import xgcm
        grid = xgcm.Grid(ds, metrics=get_metrics(ds), periodic=False)
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        Installation via pip:
        ```bash
        pip3 install xnemogcm
        ```
        
        ## Requirements for dev
        
        We use *pipenv* to set up a virtual environment containing all
        needed packages to run xnemogcm and the tests.
        To install all the dependencies, type `pipenv install --dev`
        after cloning the directory. This will create a new virtual environment.
        Typing `pipenv shell` in the package directory will activate the virtual environment.
        
        ## What's new
        
        ### v0.3.2 - v0.3.3 (2021-05-05)
        * By default adds the lat/lon/depth variables of domcfg as coordinates
        
        ### v0.3.1 (2021-05-04)
        * Minor bug fix when merging
        * better squeezing of time in domcfg + nemo v3.6 compatibility
        
        ### v0.3.0 (2021-04-13)
        * Cleaning the backend
        * Removing the saving options (that were useless and confusing)
        * Minor bug fixes
        * Tested with realistic regional configuration
        
        ### v0.2.3 (2021-03-15)
        * Support for surface only files
        * Reshaping the data files for the tests (dev)
