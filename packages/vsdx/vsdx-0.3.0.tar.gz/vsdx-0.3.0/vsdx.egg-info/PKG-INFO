Description: # vsdx - A python library for processing Visio .vsdx files
        
        #### Note: this is an early release with limited functionality
        
        example code to find a shape with specific text, remove it, and then
        save the updated .vsdx file:
        ```python
        from vsdx import VisioFile
        
        filename = 'my_file.vsdx'
        # open a visio file
        with VisioFile(filename) as vis:
            # get page shapes collection
            shapes = vis.page_objects[0].shapes
            # get shape to remove by its text value
            s = shapes[0].find_shape_by_text('Shape to remove')  # type: VisioFile.Shape
            # remove the shape if found
            if s:
                s.remove()
                # save a new copy
                vis.save_vsdx('shape_removed.vsdx')
        ```
        
        Please refer to tests/test.py for more usage examples in the form of
        pytest tests.

        ###  Change Log
        - v0.3.0: update jinja rendering to support for loops, where for
          statement is at start of group shape text, endfor is automatically
          inserted before processing. Refer to test.py::test_basic_jinja_loop()
          for code and test_jinja_loop.vsdx for content.
        - v0.2.10: add VisioFile.jinja_render_vsdx() - applying jinja processing
          to Shape.text only
        - v0.2.9: check that Page has shapes tag when in shape_copy(), add test
          to copy shape to new page
        - v0.2.8: find max shape ID in Page before creating Shape in
          Shape.copy(). Find and load master pages when file is opened, store in
          VisioFile.master_page_objects and .master_pages
        - v0.2.7: add Shape.copy() method
        - v0.2.6: added Page.get_connectors_between() to get zero or many
          connectors between two shapes, by shape id or text
        - 0.2.5: Add new Shape properties connected_shapes (list of Shape
          objects) and connects (list of Connect objects) properties to allow
          related shapes to be identified (i.e. shapes and connectors) and
          provide information on the relationship, in new Connect object. Also
          new properties of shape begin_x/y, end_x/y, plus height/width
          setters
        - 0.2.4: Added find_replace(old, new) method to Shape and Page classes
          to recursively replace old with new
        - 0.2.3: Updated tests to output files to an /out folder. Added test
          vsdx file with compound shape. Updated Shape text getter/setter
        - 0.2.2: Added x & y location setters to Shape, and move(x_delta,
          y_delta) method - both with related tests
