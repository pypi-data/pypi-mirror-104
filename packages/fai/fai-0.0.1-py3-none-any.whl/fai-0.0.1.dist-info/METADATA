-------------------------------------
Library for FAI customization scripts
-------------------------------------

This Python lib eases the implementation of FAI_ customization scripts with a
high level of abstraction and resonable error handling. It is meant to be
``import``'ed in scripts run by ``fai-do-scripts(1)`` during an FAI
installation or softupdate.

Packaging and Releasing
=======================

This lib uses PEP 517/PEP 518-compatible packaging based on setuptools. All
project settings should normally go into setup.cfg_, while setup.py_ is mainly
provided for compatibility. The build system configuration resides in
pyproject.toml_.

.. _setup.cfg: ./setup.cfg
.. _setup.py: ./setup.py
.. _pyproject.toml: ./pyproject.toml

Each released version is tagged with a tag of the form ``release/x.y.z`` with
``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` being major, minor, and patch version, respectively, as
defined by `Semantic Versioning`_.
